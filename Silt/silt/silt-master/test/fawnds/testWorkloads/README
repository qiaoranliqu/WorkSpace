to generate our predefined workload trace:

Step0, install YCSB, go to your YCSB root dir

Step1, run ./workload_gen.sh [path-to-YSCB] 

===================================================
useful options to customize workloads:

{insert,read,update,scan}proportion  -- the portion to send given type of queires 
operationcount -- the number of operations
fieldcount     -- the number of fields in the table. For our K-V application, we can simply set this option to 1 (just a "value" field)
recordcount    -- the number of different keys inserted or read. In YCSB, keys will look like "user1941507751" 
fieldlength    -- the length of value when insert to the DB
